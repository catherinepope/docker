# Networking Overview

Docker uses the Container Networking Model (CNM) to manage networking for Docker containers.

- **Network Driver** - handles the actual implementation of CNM concepts.
- **IPAM Driver** - means IP Address Management. Automatically allocates subnets and IP addresses for networks and endpoints.
